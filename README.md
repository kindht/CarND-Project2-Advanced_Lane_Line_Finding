# CarND-Term1-Project2-Advanced_Lane_Line_Finding


This is the 2nd project in Term 1 for the **Self-Driving Car Engineer** Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://cn.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer--nd013)

The goals / steps of this project are the following: 

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position
* Output video with lane lines detected drawn
